Uplink ðŸ“¡
*********
A Declarative HTTP Client for Python. Inspired by `Retrofit
<http://square.github.io/retrofit/>`__.

|Release| |Python Version| |License| |Coverage Status| |Gitter|

.. note::

   Uplink is currently in initial development. Until the official
   release (``v1.0.0``), the public API should be considered provisional.
   Although we don't expect any considerable changes to the API at this point,
   please avoid using the code in production, for now.

   However, while Uplink is under construction, we invite eager users to
   install early and provide open feedback, which can be as simple as
   opening a GitHub issue when you notice a missing feature, latent
   defect, documentation oversight, etc.

   Moreover, for those interested in contributing, checkout the `Contribution
   Guide on GitHub`_!

.. _`Contribution Guide on GitHub`: https://github.com/prkumar/uplink/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.rst

Uplink turns your HTTP API into a Python class.

.. code-block:: python

   from uplink import Consumer, get, headers, Path, Query

   class GitHub(Consumer):

      @get("users/{user}/repos")
      def list_repos(self, user: Path, sort_by: Query("sort")):
         """Get user's public repositories."""

Build an instance to interact with the webservice.

.. code-block:: python

   github = GitHub(base_url="https://api.github.com/")

Then, executing an HTTP request is as simply as invoking a method.

.. code-block:: python

   repos = github.list_repos("octocat", sort_by="created")

The returned object is a friendly :py:class:`requests.Response`:

.. code-block:: python

   print(repos.json())
   # Output: [{'id': 64778136, 'name': 'linguist', ...

For sending non-blocking requests, Uplink comes with support for
:py:mod:`aiohttp` and :py:mod:`twisted` (`example
<https://github.com/prkumar/uplink/tree/master/examples/async-requests>`_).

Features
========

- **Quickly Define Structured API Clients**

  - Use decorators and function annotations to describe the HTTP request.
  - URL parameter replacement, request headers, and query parameter support.
  - JSON, URL-encoded, and multipart request body and file upload.

- **Bring Your Own HTTP Library**

  - Use Requests by default.
  - Send non-blocking HTTP requests with Aiohttp or Twisted.
  - Supply your own ``requests.Session`` or ``aiohttp.ClientSession`` object
    for greater control.

- **Directly Convert Response Bodies into Python Objects**

  - Built-in support for |marshmallow|_ schemas.
  - Define `custom converters`_ for your own objects.
  - Built-in support for `converting collections`_ (e.g., list of Users).

- **Middleware**

  - Inject `custom response and error handling`_.

- **Authentication**

  - Built-in support for Basic Authentication.
  - Works with external auth support for Requests or Aiohttp.

Uplink officially supports Python 2.7 & 3.3-3.7.

User Testimonials
===============

**Michael Kennedy** (`@mkennedy`_), host of `Talk Python`_ and `Python Bytes`_ podcasts-

   Of course our first reaction when consuming HTTP resources in Python is to
   reach for requests. But for *structured* APIs, we often want more than ad-hoc
   calls to requests. We want a client-side API for our apps. uplink is
   the quickest and simplest way to build just that client-side API.
   Highly recommended.

**Or Carmi** (`@liiight`_), notifiers_ maintainer-

    Uplinkâ€™s intelligent usage of decorators and typing leverages the most
    pythonic features in an elegant and dynamic way. If you need to create an
    API abstraction layer, there is really no reason to look elsewhere.
