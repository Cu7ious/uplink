Uplink ðŸ“¡
==========
A Declarative HTTP Client for Python, inspired by `Retrofit
<http://square.github.io/retrofit/>`__.

|Release| |Python Version| |License| |Coverage Status|

.. note:: **Uplink** is currently in alpha development and, thus, not
    production ready at the moment. However, while the package is under
    construction, enthusiastic early adopters are more than welcome to install
    and provide feedback, as we work towards the official release. Moreover,
    for those interested in contributing, I plan to publish a contribution
    guide soon, but in the meantime, please feel free to reach out!

**A simple example, with GitHub API v3:**

Using decorators and function annotations, you can turn any plain old Python
class into an HTTP API consumer:

.. code-block:: python

    from uplink import *

    # To register entities that are common to all API requests, you can
    # decorate the enclosing class rather than each method separately:
    @headers({"Accept": "application/vnd.github.v3.full+json"})
    class GitHubService(object):

        @get("/users/{username}")
        def get_user(self, username):
            """Get a single user."""

        @json
        @patch("/user")
        def update_user(self, access_token: Query, **info: Body):
            """Update an authenticated user."""

To construct a consumer instance, use the helper function :py:func:`uplink.build`:

.. code-block:: python

    github = build(GitHubService, base_url="https://api.github.com/")

This instance provides a well-defined, accessible interface to the Web API:

.. code-block:: python

    r = github.update_user(token, bio="Beam me up, Scotty!").execute()

And *voila*, :py:meth:`update_user` seamlessly builds the request (using the
decorators and annotations from the method's definition), and
:py:meth:`execute` sends that synchronously over the network. Furthermore,
the returned response :py:obj:`r` is a :py:class:`requests.Response`
(`documentation
<http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/api/#requests.Response>`__):

.. code-block:: python

    print(r.json()) # {u'disk_usage': 216141, u'private_gists': 0, ...

In essence, **Uplink** enables you to create self-descriptive and conveniently
shareable API clients, for minimal code and effort.
