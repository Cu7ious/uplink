Uplink ðŸ“¡
==========
A Declarative HTTP Client for Python, inspired by `Retrofit
<http://square.github.io/retrofit/>`__.

|Release| |Python Version| |License| |Coverage Status|

.. note::

   **Uplink** is currently in initial development and, therefore, not
   production ready at the moment. Furthermore, as the package follows the
   `Semantic Versioning Specification <http://semver.org/>`__, the public
   API outlined in this documentation should not be considered stable until the
   release of :code:`v1.0.0`.

   However, while **Uplink** is under construction, we invite eager users
   to install early and provide open feedback, which can be as simple as
   opening a GitHub issue when you notice a missing feature, latent defect,
   documentation oversight, etc.

   Moreover, for those interested in contributing, I plan to publish a
   contribution guide soon, but in the meantime, please feel free to fork
   the `repository on GitHub <https://github.com/prkumar/uplink>`__ and open
   a pull request ('tis
   `Hacktoberfest <https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/>`__, after all)!

A Quick Walkthrough, with GitHub API v3:
----------------------------------------

Using decorators and function annotations, you can turn any plain old Python
class into an HTTP API consumer:

.. code-block:: python

    from uplink import *

    # To register entities that are common to all API requests, you can
    # decorate the enclosing class rather than each method separately:
    @headers({"Accept": "application/vnd.github.v3.full+json"})
    class GitHubService(object):

        @get("/users/{username}")
        def get_user(self, username):
            """Get a single user."""

        @json
        @patch("/user")
        def update_user(self, access_token: Query, **info: Body):
            """Update an authenticated user."""

To construct a consumer instance, use the helper function :py:func:`uplink.build`:

.. code-block:: python

    github = build(GitHubService, base_url="https://api.github.com/")

To access the GitHub API with this instance, we simply invoke any of the methods
that we defined in the interface above. To illustrate, let's update my GitHub
profile's bio:

.. code-block:: python

    r = github.update_user(token, bio="Beam me up, Scotty!").execute()

*Voila*, :py:meth:`update_user` seamlessly builds the request (using the
decorators and annotations from the method's definition), and
:py:meth:`execute` sends that synchronously over the network. Furthermore,
the returned response :py:obj:`r` is a :py:class:`requests.Response`
(`documentation
<http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/api/#requests.Response>`__):

.. code-block:: python

    print(r.json()) # {u'disk_usage': 216141, u'private_gists': 0, ...

In essence, **Uplink** delivers API consumers that are self-describing,
reusable, and fairly compact, with minimal user effort.
